	  <h3>What did you do like the least about the class?</h3>
      <p>Most definitely did not enjoy the tests. They were too long for the amount of time we were given. The worst part of it is the guess work going into the
      test. You might be able to memorize most of what you need to code up, in order to give you as much as possible to work out surprise questions, but the possibility
      that you memorized everything need was very slim. This means you'll most likely run out of time on a problem you know, but can't finish in time.</p>
      
      <p>
      In summary, the problems themselves aren't that hard. If studying for the class is taken seriously they are completely doable. Just don;t expect to finish 100%
      of the test.</p>
      <br> 
    
    <h3>What did you like most about the class?</h3>
      <p>I liked the programming projects. I thought they were difficult without being too difficult. They also normally fit nicely into what we were learning at
      the time. So you could learn something in class, have an epiphany on the problem, and then go home and program the piece you'd been struggling with.</p>
      <br>
	  
    <h3>What's the most significant thing you learned?</h3>
      <p>Probably the intrcacies of the C++ syntax and stl design philosophies. Don't get me wrong, I still thing the language is syntactically bloated,
      and features are obscure (causing errors to be obscure) and possibly more troublesome than worth bothering with, but going through the class 
      definitely shed light on the WHY in reading C++ code. Move, copy, friend, inheritance, constants, were all explained very well, and are important for
      any programmer interested in OOP to know.</p>
      <br>
      
    <h3>How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?</h3>
      <p>I probably spent around 20-30 hours a week on each project. Keep in mind though, I only did one of the projects with a partner. When I was with a
      partner I would say that time was halved. </p>
      <br>
      
    <h3>How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?</h3>
      <p>I probably spent about 1 hour a week reading. When a test was coming up I would spend about 20-30 hours practicing for it (most likely spread out over
      a longer period than a week). The readings themselves are fairly short and easy to follow. If you read a lot of articles anyways like I do, it's really not
      much of a chore to read a couple of more before breakfast or bed.</p>
      <br>
      
    <h3>How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</h3>
      <p>Hmmmmmm... That's a difficult question. I would say each project might have been a little more than a thousand lines of code. Then guessing the tests are
      roughly equivilant, I'd say I wrote 6-7 thousands lines.</p>
      <br>
      
    <h3>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</h3>
      <p>I don't know if it was completely required, but I really enjoyed Docker. I think I use it for every class now, just because its easier than opening up a VM
      or SSHing while I'm at home. Additionally I like the concept of Continuous Integration, and I especially like how GitLab has their pipeline set up (albeit the
      pipeline does run like a tortoise in a hair race).</p>
      <br>
      
    <h3>If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</h3>
      <p>Lengthen the test time. I believe the problems are important and they should all be tested over, buuuuuut it's too much in such little time. Especially when
      people get nervous and they're having to program in an online IDE, in an unfamiliar environment, etc. Not everyone can speed write code. Some people (me) are slow,
      methodical thinkers who like to take their time and think through scenarios before jumping in. I don't beleive the testing environment is taking those type
      of people into account, and it's leaving them rather short changed.</p>
