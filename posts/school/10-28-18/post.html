	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>This past week I finished a couple of projects, did a lot of math homework, and tried to get a jumpstart on all of the homework that will be coming up in the next couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>I've dated two midterms and three projects coming up that I'm really trying to get ahead on and start studying for now. I figure if I stay ahead then time spent studying will be more spread out and less of an exhausting sprint.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>Right now just busy work that I need to get done as soon as possible so I can start focusing on the more important work I have to do.</p>
    <p>Also, to bring up current events... The water lockdown has been kind of a drag, and I never really realized how many times I filled my water bottle in a day until I wasn't able to anymore.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>This next week I'll be submitting projects and studying for more midterms. The studying never ends.</p>
      <p>I'm also going on a hunting trip this weekend. If course I'll be packing my books to take into the stand with me. I just wish I could take my computer so I could finish my online classes too.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What did you think of the Atlassian talk?</h3>
      <p>I thought it was very informative. I think it's interesting to see what other companies are like. I was really curious to hear about their working and lab environment at Atlassian. Since I've always been on more of an classical
      engineering team rather than one that is focused purely on developing software, I really wanted to know how their workflow and development cycle differed from my experiences. I got to find out a little bit about their habits after the speech.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      
      <a href="https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/">OpenAI Blog</a>
      <p>My pick of the week is OpenAI's DoTA project. I recently just started playing the game. It's a very nuanced, and a highly situational type of game that is difficult for humans to even master. For instance I've only been playing for 2 weeks and
      I can still barely help my team out. The fact that the team has created a program that can play a successful game, much less win is very shocking and highly important. I think it is a very important hallmark in history for computer science.</p>
