      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>I was very preoccupied with the career fair this past week. I already have a job offer, so I wasn't really expecting to spend that much time shoppin around, but in the end all of the activities took up the second half of my week.
      </p>
      <p>Other than the career fair I worked on Collatz, which took up the beginning half of my week! I'll talk more about this below.
      </p>
      <p>In between Collatz though I was reviewing the various pointer syntax for C++. I honestly had no idea the four const cases for pointers existed before coming to this class. That topic was rather informative to me.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p>Right now I'm struggling with staying organized and getting all the work I need to get done, done. Everything seemed to creep up at the end of September. This is also starting to feel like one of those semesters where all of my projects and midterms will be due at the same time. This sucks, but of course the only remedy is to stay organized. I've started sitting down on Fridays and blocking out the times for the following week where I need to work and study for various classes. Hopefully this will help me stay ahead.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>Next week comes my next non-class blog post. Additionally I'll be working on Project 2 for this class, finsishing some assignments for my online classes, and studying for a math test.</p>
      <p>I'm also going to be putting together a review for some of the topics we've learned in this class, just so I'll be prepared for the upcoming test in OOP.</p> 
      <br>
      <h3>What's your experience of Project #1?</h3>
      <p>Project 1 was fun. I had a good time coding the solutions in Hackerrank. The only complaint I had was the organization of all the pieces needed for submission. I'm still kind of nervous there were parts I didn't do right or that I forgot. I probably checked everything four or five times over before finally submitting.</p>
      <p>I think if the workflow and the assignment checklist were a single sheet or more cohesive with each other then submission would have been less stressful.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p>My pick of the week is really nerdy, but I hope you stay with me. I really love documentaries, I really love youtube, and I really love old computers. So together, here's all 3. 
      </p>
      <p>The 8-bit guy on youtube has a few interesting videos, but my favorite series he does (which is still on going) are on the Commodore computer line. If you don't know Commodore is one of the original personal computing companies, having released their first computers around the same time Apple first arrived on the scene. The 8-bit guy follows the history of this now defunct company by going through every piece of hardware in their aging lineup, from the original PET, presumably to the Amiga. I highly reccemond the series.</p>
