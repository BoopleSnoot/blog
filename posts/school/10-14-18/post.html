	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>This week it feels like I haven't spent 5 minutes outside the cover of a textbook. There were a lot of assignments due this week, for whatever reason. However, next week looks like it will start to slow down. I guess the extra work is just a product of midterm season.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>Time. Time seems to always be in my way. There are so many things that I want to work on and get done, but when I sit down to work in the morning and then look up at the clock it's already midnight.</p>
	  <p>Specifically for this class I need to brush up on the range iterator class notes, and a few other areas. I know we get to use a study guide during the test, but I do want to memorize several items, such as the order of the iterators, before sitting down in the ECJ tomorrow.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>Next week I am working on my Symbolic Programming for AI project, and hopefully going to get some time to work on this blog a little bit more. Additionally I have two midterms next week that I will be studying for.</p>
	  <p>And can't forget the test in CS371P!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What was your experience of learning the basics of C++?</h3>
      <p>Honestly I was kind of blown away by how much I didn't know. I had assumed (and you know what they say about assuming...) that I knew most of what the language had to offer already, but I was completely wrong. It's very intriguing to me how
	  everything in the language (and the standard library) seems to be set up to support a very specific "Software Engineered" way of thinking. It's fun to think like the creators and extenders of the language. It's aloso fun to understand why some of C++'s
	  quirks are the way they are.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU">A Breadboard Computer</a></p>
	  <p>So, fun fact, I actually transferred from a different college into the University of Texas. At my prior university I took a class called Digital Logic, which as it sounds is essentially learning to build a computer from logic gates (beeps and boops).
	  After that class had ended I figured I knew enough to make my own simple computer on a breadboard, and decided to see if anyone else had thought of the same idea. Of course they had, and I stumbled onto Ben Eater's channel.
	  </p>
	  <p>As the title implies, he built a breaboard computer, but what's more amazing is he goes through the entire process of making it. He has a playlist where he explains the math and theory between each component of the computer. Personally I think its one of the best
	  technical series ever made on YouTube.</p>
	  <p>And while I love UT, I am grateful for my past educational experiences, especially when I think back and remember that they lead me to fun ideas like a breadboard computer.</p>
