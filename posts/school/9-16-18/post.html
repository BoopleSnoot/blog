      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>I worked on the site a lot last Friday, reorganized it, fixed some links, made a couple of pages. Oh, and I made my first non-school <a href="../../projects/9-14-18/brief-outline.html">post</a>.
	Other than that, for school, I've been working on Collatz and my other programming class, trying to keep up with the workload.
      </p>
      <p>In other news, I went to the Engineering career fair, just for the awkward fun of going. For being a past intern, I also received an invitation to the Lockheed Martin recruiting lunch last Thursday.
	I went and actually had a lot of fun. Business is booming, and by next May they're trying to hire 3000 more people at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics alone. So if you're reading this and
	hunting for a job...
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p>I'm going to go ahead and say nothing again. I have a lot of work to do today and tomorrow, but nothing I would consider "in my way." Then again, talk to me Monday night and ask me how I'm doing.</p>
      <p>In regards to this website, I've realized a big wall is money. I'm trying eventually run a small CMS and web server on a PaaS like Google's Compute Cloud or AWS.
	Unfortunately, the nice tiers of PaaS are expensive for a college student. It looks like I will be forced to use Google's free tier. The free tier boasts a whopping 0.2 vCPU and a whopping 600MB of memory.<br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>Next week has a few stages. First is Collatz, then its online class modules, and then I plan on driving back home for the weekend. I'm a little behind in my online classes, simply because I feel like
      I haven't gotten the chance to breathe at the beginning of this semester.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your experience of the in-class exercises</h3>
      <p>I wasn't such a big fan, but that's because I was fighting with my laptop the entire time, trying to connect to the internet, and then trying to rush to finish the exercise. The next one I should be
      more prepared so hopefully I'll have a better experience.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p>Let's talk about LISts and Processors. Let's talk about LISPs.</p>
      <p>LISP is the second oldest programming language, second only to Fortran. It also has the distinct quality of having code-as-data and data-as-code. Additionally an entire program can be described and run
	as a single data structure. A list. </p>
      <p>LISP is quirky, weird, and different, but I highly suggest trying the language. An easy and influential LISP to get up and running is <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, a LISP that runs on the
	Java Virtual Machine. If you ever had the want to use recursion more than you use loops, discover what super nerds mean when they evangelize functional programming, or just go back in time and learn
	what our forefathers used to use, try LISP.
