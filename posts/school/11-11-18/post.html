	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>I studied and took a couple of midterms this past week. Honestly the semester just keeps grinding on. I worked a bit on my project for another class as well, and I even had some time to finish a novel I've been reading.</p>
      <p>For this class I actually didn't do much. I was caught up working on other assignments. However, I did look over the Vector files, and I'll be finishing all of those practice problems this week in preparation for the next test.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>Right now I don't have much in my way. For my other project I've been having to ssh into the CS lab machines, which creates a tedious and inefficient workflow. Other than that I don;t have much else to complain about. </p>
    <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>This next week I'm finishing Project #4 for this class and, like I said earlier, I'll be completing the vector exercises to stay ahead. I also need to go back and review a couple of things from earlier in the semester. Mainly references and pointer material.</p>
      <h3>Insights on SOLID?</h3>
      <p>I know this is probably against the grain, but I didn't beleive the articles were that insightful. Some of those designs, if not all of them, could be done procedurally, or better yet functionally. Reading them I began to form the opinion that
      C++ is considered a difficult language because it is designed to be a used a VERY specific way. The common bugs and incorrect thinking that we've discussed in class are often caused by the user-programmer not fully understanding these specific
      concepts, and how they're intended/should be used. The whole design of C++ feels... inflexible, and SOLID feels built up to cover, patch, and somehow extend, that inflexibility.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      
      <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/">Google Compute Cloud</a>
      <p>So my pick of the week is more of an encouragement of the week. I've been playing around with platform service providers lately, and the one I've kind of settled with is Google. I like their specific options, mainly because their site and documentation
      appears the most straighforward. Whether its GCP, AWS, or Azure, I encourage all students to at least look into these services because I do believe they are becoming the driving force of application deployment in our field.</p>
