      <figcaption>Hey That's Me</figcaption>
      <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>So I've decided for the forseeable future that I'll be writing about my work on the website here, with the occasional nod to the projects I have to complete in CS 371p. </p>
      <p>I accomplished a lot more this week than I had initially believed I would get done. A quick list of the tasks I accomplished include: redesigned the page layout, worked out a new structure for the navbar, added Boop (the site mascot) to the homepage, created an About Me page, created a separate URL, and linked my GitHub profile. This work was all done during boring downtimes during the past week.</p>
      <p>As for the Collatz project, I'm a little annoyed that GitLab is being used instead of GitHub, as I've always used GitHub. I didn't do much work on Collatz this week, other than look at the documentation and get a decent grasp on the work that needs to be done.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p>In regards to Collatz, the general programming algorithm that we have to solve doesn't appear to be that difficult. I have a small plan in the back of my head to beat the HackerRank speed tests by solving the problem with memoisation. Whether or not that is the correct approach will only become apparent once I begin the testing cycle.</p>
      <p>For the most part, the difficult parts of the project seem to simply getting the workflow, unit testing, and "extra" bits done. They aren't adding so much to the "core" code, but they seem to be the more emphasized tasks of this assignment.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>Starting tomorrow I'm going to begin working on Collatz, fully diving into the workflow page on the class website. I've already completed most of steps 1-3, but I still don't feel like I've started the full busy work of the project yet.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your experience of the class?</h3>
      <p>So far my experience has been positive. I feel like the lectures are informative and engaging, and that the work allows students to get as much out of the class as they're willing to put in. I also really enjoy how well organized everything seems to be. Although I will say, the multiple sites and platforms we're using makes the information distribution slightly peeving. Sometimes I feel like I'm searching for a bit of information for longer than my question is worth. But it hasn't been such a problem that I've had to ask a Piazza question to find anything, so the issue is livable for the moment. </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://monster6502.com/">Monster 6502</a></p>
      <p>If it's not obvious yet from my last post, I really like retro computer hardware. The Monster 6502 project leaders obviously take that admiration to the next level. For the uninitiated, the 6502 is the microprocessor at the heart of most home computers built in the 1970s through the 1980s. Probably the most important computer built, the Apple II, was at its core a 6502 machine.</p>
      <p>The Monster 6502 project essentially takes the die image of the 6502 and enlarges it by recreating its digital logic with discrete transistors. Additionally, the board is equipped with LEDs so the registers and status bits can be seen without a terminal. The project site has more information and is definitely worth a read.</p>
      <p>Enjoy.</p>
