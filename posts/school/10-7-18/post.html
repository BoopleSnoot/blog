      <figcaption>Hey That's Me</figcaption>
	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>It's been nonstop work for me for the past few days. Online classes, programming, personal projects, tests, homework... Crucnhc season is here, and it's rather exhausting. The middle of the semester always hits hard,
	  but at least this semester my work has seemed to fall into more of a rythym than in the past.</p>
	  <p>Of course one of the projects I worked on was for this class, the "Voting Problem" which I'll talk a bit about more later. </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
      <p>What isn't?</p>
	  <p>Literally just thinking about all the work that needs to get done stresses me out a bit. I have two projects, a paper,  and several homework assignments due this week. I'd say that those are all in my way. The massive workload 
	  feels like its holding me back at the moment.</p>
	  <p>Naturally I'm trying to take steps to fix this, such as stay organized, up to date, and on time, but sometimes there's just a lot to get done and not enough time.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>I've already talked about it a little bit but I'm really just going to be working on homework this entire week. There's a lot to get done.</p>
	  <p>In addition to that work though, I'm going to be studying for the test that is in this class. I need to review pointers vs references a bit more, and brush up on the range subject that we went over last week. Most of that
	  went over my head at the time, so I'll probably be stopping in for office hours this week, just to get a nice review.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your experience of the readings, so far?</h3>
      <p>Project 2 was fun! I did it in a couple of sittings, which I don't recommend. I also fell into the rut of making the program one way the first time and then not wanting to change the design down the line, mostly due to time cost.
      </p>
	  <p>If I could go back in time and redo the whole thing I have a way using objects in my mind that I think would have been a lot more organized than what I ended up submitting. After reading the Open and Closed principle well designed/defined
	  objects have just been floating around in my head, and they've had me stewing over the probable subpar work I did. But c'est la vie. If it were a true project I could go back and edit the codebase, but seeing as how its a school project I
	  think I settle with learning from my mistakes.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/t1e8gqXLbsU">Monads</a></p>
	  <p>So after the weekly reading <a href="/assets/OCP-1996.pdf">"The Open-Closed Principle"</a> I realized that I had run across this type of thinking while researching and doing Functional Programming. Monads are hard to wrap your mind around
	  at first but I do believe they're trying to acheive a similar level of modularity of state that Object Oriented Programming tends to evangalize. If you've ever had to deal with Javascript or even the Java type-casting system, you've probably
	  used the ideas behind monads without a formal structure. I highly recommend looking into the subject.
