	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>This past week I finished midterm season... Boy that was a loooong one. But I'm glad it's over. Of course we took the final for CS371P, which was an intersting and new experience. More on that below. </p>
      <p>In other news,I actually just finished my online final which used ProctorU. To be completely honest, the whole process of using ProctorU was rather stressful. What really threw me off was that the service does not allow you to use
      a Linux system (which is what I have on my laptop). I don't have a camera on my PC, so I was forced to use my roommates laptop. Quite the inconvenience.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>Nothing, and that makes me happy. The sprint that was midterms and projects is over, and now its just a nice marathon to the end of the semester. In regards to this class I need to meet up with my partner and finalize the meeting times for working on our project, but that's not a big worry.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>Next week is beginning project week. I have project 3 for this class and another project for Symbolic Programming that I need to do. I also am going to start reading the enxt units for my online classes, despite just finishing the tests. Additionally I need to catch back up with my Statistics class so I make sure I don't fall behind.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What was your experience of Test #1?</h3>
      <p>Test 1 was okay, but I'm kicking myself for the time management that I had. I knew how to finish the last two problems but I got stuck on a few logic bugs and wasn't watching the clock close enough. Before I knew it time ran out. Had I realized
      the passing time I would have skipped around and soaked up as many pooints as possible before continuing debugging the error.</p>
      <p> I guess it's just frustrating because I've never done a programming competition where an answer needs to be submitted in a short time span. I've traditionally had time to mull over a question for a long period of time and decide an 
      appropriate well thought out course of action. The test was definitely a learning experience and I'll be a lot more prepared for the next one.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yGqAAw-7klE">Paul Allen</a></p>
      <p>I'd be remissed if I didn't say RIP Paul Allen. His life is an important piece of history in computer science, and many people owe him for the technological contributions he and his partner brought to the masses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Mpo6rgvOVGc">Great Big Story: The History of Ctrl+Alt+Del</a></p>
      <p>Beyond Paul Allen, I'd like to share a fun and interesting story about a frustrating key combonation that you may not have thought much about before. I like Great Big Story's channel because they offer a lot of fun and thought provoking
      insights into everyday items or ideas. They are a really good short documentary channel, and I hope you check them out beyond just this video.
