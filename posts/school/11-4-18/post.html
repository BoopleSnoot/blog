	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>This past week I finished the allocator project with my partner and studied for some upcoming exams. I really spent most of my weekend working on my online classes, as I had several assignments due on Friday and today (Sunday).</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>I don't really think I have anything in my way at the moment. I have to study of course, but at this point in the semester that is feeling mundane and routine.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>After my test I'll be devoting 100% of my time towards the Darwin project in CS371P. I plan to do the objects a little differently at first than the provided example he gave us in class. The only reason I want to divert from the norm is
      because I believe my way will be a little faster for me to implement, and potentially less trail-and-error bug prone.</p>
      <h3>What was your experience of Project 3?</h3>
      <p>I had a good experience. I realized what a time saver working with a partner can be. Although there were a few things I probably would have done differently, I'd say the collective effort and relatively well paced timing that paired 
      programming can bring is well worth the effort.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      
      <a href="https://youtu.be/_2uXqTi42LI">The Gigatron</a>
      <p>So as software developers we're often thinking at high levels of abstraction, so for me, diving a little lower can be a fun refreshing exercise. The Gigatron is one example of low level computing theory put into practice. As is explained in
      the video, there was a world of computers before the microprocessor (sorry Intel). This world was in fact not computer-less. Instead computers were made with gate logic using TTL chips. That's exactly what the Gigatron is. A modern example 
      of a TTL computer. I hope you enjoy the video as much as I did.</p>
