      <figcaption>Hey That's Me</figcaption>
	  <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
      <p>I've mainly been working on my online classes, keeping up with them. I've also been reviewing the course material for statistics, playing catch up a bit.</p>

<p> Outside of school I went up to DFW to watch the Big 12 Championship. The game was a major heartbreak, with UT losing, but the trip was fun nonetheless.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
	  <p>I don't have much in my way right now, other than the need to start reviewing for finals. I think I'm going to compile the material I need to study over the next couple of days and outline the goals I need to keep for each subject/test I'm revieing for.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
      <p>I kind of already hit this point above, but I want to set out a study and work schedule. I'll also be working on my last programming assignment for the year intermittently throughout the week.</p>
      
<h3>What did you think of the Google Talk?</h3>
<p>I thought it was generally a pretty informative speech. I especially liked the insight about multiple career paths being available to graduates. Makes you realize that there's a lot more to the world than just programming. </p>
      <h3>What are your experiences on Project 5?</h3>
      <p>Project 5 was fun! It was by far the smoothest project to develop for, and although it might have been the most "complicated" design, it felt like the fastest to program. I think this was for a number of reasons. One, by this time in the semester the workflow is basically second nature. Two, the experience from Project 4, a pretty similar project, felt easily translatable. Three, designing the program beforehand gave me a pretty good mental image of the code before I started even working.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>What's your pick of the week?</h3>
      
      <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/events/ai-innovation-challenge.html">Alpha Pilot</a>
    
      <p>So I heard whisperings about this a while back, but essentially it's just starting to pick up some wind. Lockheed Martin is starting a competition for AI controlled/piloted drone systems. Your ultimate goal really is to get the drones to fly a drone race as fast as possible... autonomously. The real catch is your realistic competition are HUMAN piloted drones. Winning the competition against other bots is all well and good, but there is extra (monetary) incentive if even the human can be bested. I encourage you to click the link above if the contest sounds interesting and it feels like something worth competing in. Total cash awards are 2 million, so it's not like the work would go without reward. </p>
