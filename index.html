      <figcaption> Welcome </figcaption>
      <p>Well hey there, and welcome to my site. My name's Matthew Nash, and this site started as a class project (CS 371p Fall 2018) in which I had to do a blog post each week. While each person had the opportunity to use an easy blogging format such as Wordpress, I opted instead to take the opportunity to teach myself some web development skills. The hope is to keep this blog and website going, posting once a week, even after the class comes to a close. I'm not sure if I have enough wisdom to share for it to be excruciatingly interesting for a weekly read, but in the words of Socrates, "<a href="http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/13726/7.html#gsc.tab=0">I do not fancy I know what I do not know.</a>" So at the very least, if you think you'll find enjoyment in reading someone's blunders through life, with the occasional tidbit of hard-earned wisdom, self-meditated ignorance, and an introduction to a few technical tools, please dive in. </p>
